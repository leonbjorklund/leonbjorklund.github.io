# My Personal Page

This is the first iteration of my personal website.

It's a simple page, displaying projects, resume and contact. 

Unfortunately too much time was spent on HTML & CSS and not enough on javaScript. Future iterations will definitely have more JS functionality added.

In hindsight shouldn't have used bootstrap and instead should have created own CSS.
